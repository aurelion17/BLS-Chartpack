This R Markdown script: 
1. connects to the ECB/SDW APIs to download data from the ECB Bank Lending Survey (BLS);
2. produces charts that represent the evolution of credit standards and demand for firms, households and consumer.

The charts are produced for Euro Area, as an aggregate, and for the 4 main economies: France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
